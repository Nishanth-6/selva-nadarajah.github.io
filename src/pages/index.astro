            <p>
              Before joining UIC, I did my PhD and MS in Operations Research at the Tepper School of Business, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. My journey to North America started at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">University of Waterloo</a>, where I obtained an MASc in Operations Research and learnt the importance of asking <a href="https://selvan.people.uic.edu/UWWhyNot.jpg" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">"Why Not?"</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="pt-2">
              I was born in <a href="https://www.incredibleindia.org/" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">incredible India</a> and grew up in the beautiful island of <a href="https://www.srilanka.travel/" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Sri Lanka</a> (a.k.a. the pearl of the Indian ocean) before heading back to Chennai for my undergraduate studies at the <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Indian Institute of Technology Madras</a>. I have enjoyed consulting with companies in the retail, high technology, and energy industries along the way.
